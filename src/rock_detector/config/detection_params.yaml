# =======================================================
# Parameters for the Python Rock Detector Node
# =======================================================

# --- Input Topics ---
# These must match the topics published by your camera driver (ZED, RealSense, or Gazebo).
image_topic: "/camera/color/image_raw"
depth_topic: "/camera/depth/image_rect_raw" # Use the rectified depth image
camera_info_topic: "/camera/color/camera_info"

# --- YOLOv8 Model Configuration ---
# Provide the absolute path to your trained YOLOv8 model.
model_path: "/path/to/your/yolov8_rocks.pt"
confidence_threshold: 0.65  # Minimum confidence to consider a detection.
nms_threshold: 0.45         # Non-Maximum Suppression threshold.

# --- Detection & Targeting ---
# The exact name of the object class you want to target (e.g., 'rock').
target_class_name: "rock"

# --- TF Broadcast Configuration ---
# This MUST be the frame ID of the camera's optical center, where the 3D point is calculated.
# - ZED2i:       "zed2i_left_camera_optical_frame"
# - RealSense:   "camera_depth_optical_frame"
# - Gazebo:      Check your URDF, often "camera_link_optical" or similar.
camera_optical_frame_id: "camera_depth_optical_frame"

# The base name for the broadcasted TF frame. It will be suffixed with an ID
# (e.g., "target_rock_1", "target_rock_2").
target_frame_base_name: "target_rock"
